# David Williamson @ Varilink Computing Ltd

In this GitHub account I share my work as a Linux and blockchain system administrator and full-stack web developer, where it can be made public. The repositories herein are predominantly not packaged applications but I share them in case they are useful to anybody  who is tackling similar challenges and might benefit from seeing how somebody else did it. I also [blog](https://www.varilink.co.uk/) on selected topics related to this work for the same reason.
