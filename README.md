# David Williamson @ Varilink Computing Ltd

In this GitHub account I share my work as an open source web developer and blockchain and system administrator where it can be made public. I work on a freelance basis through my personal services company, [Varilink Computing Ltd](https://www.varilink.co.uk/).

The repositories herein are predominantly not packaged applications but I share them in case they are useful to anybody  who is tackling similar challenges and might benefit from seeing how somebody else did it. I link repositories to [projects](https://github.com/varilink?tab=projects&type=classic&query=is%3Aopen+sort%3Aname-asc) but I don't use the project board functionality within GitHub, so here it's only a means to associate repositories with the project that they pertain to and assign a description at the project level. My repository naming convention prefixes each repository name with a shorthand project name followed by a hyphen.
